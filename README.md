# Geographic Data Clustering
This repository contains the code for clustering geographic data using the K-means algorithm. The dataset used in this project includes longitude and latitude coordinates extracted from an Excel file. This repository contains the code developed for the final project of my Data Mining class, completed in December 2021. 

## Introduction
The goal of this project is to cluster geographic data points based on their longitude and latitude coordinates. The K-means algorithm is employed to partition the data into distinct clusters, where each cluster is represented by its centroid.

## Contents
-	Clustering_project.py: Python script containing the implementation of the K-means clustering algorithm for geographic data.
-	LatLong.xlsx: Excel file containing the longitude and latitude coordinates of data points.

## Dataset
The dataset (LatLong.xlsx) contains longitude and latitude coordinates of geographic locations. These coordinates are used as input features for the clustering algorithm.
